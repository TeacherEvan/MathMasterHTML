### Session Start

**Task 1 (Completed):** Analyzed `MathMasterHTML.mdc` and removed all references to "Unity" to align with the new project direction.

**Task 2 (Completed):** Clarified the high-level project vision, establishing the following core principles:
- **Technology Stack:** The project will be a "Custom-Built House" using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Core Principle:** The game is a "plug-and-play" cognitive exercise.
- **Strict Adherence:** No new features will be added unless explicitly requested by the developer.
- **No Persistence:** No user accounts, save data, or multi-user features will be implemented.

**Task 3 (Completed):** Defining detailed game mechanics based on developer feedback.
- **Worm Mechanic:** Clarified behavior regarding stealing symbols and player interaction.
- **Game Flow:** Outlined the sequence from Welcome Screen to the main 3-part gameplay window.
- **Clarification Pending:** The exact function of the "Green Help button" is awaiting developer input.

**Next Steps for Next Session:**
1. Await developer clarification on the Help Button's function.
2. Establish the foundational structure of the project (HTML, CSS, JS files).
3. Implement the problem generation logic for the different difficulty levels.
4. Begin building the Welcome Screen as per the `MathMasterHTML.mdc` specification.

**New Core Parameters (How to survive Mr E):**
1.  **Do what he says and only what he says.** If you want to do something cute, just clarify first. I have a whole plan already in my head and small things can throw me off.
2.  **No assumptions.** Never, ever.
3.  **Short and sweet responses.** I'll ask you to elaborate.

**Task 1 (Completed):** Generated 50 easy algebra problems with solutions, and after several failures, formatted them correctly in `50-easy-algebra-problems.md`.
**Task 2 (Completed):** Corrected the `MathMasterHTML.mdc` blueprint to remove incorrect "Matrix-style" symbols and equations, replacing them with the user's specific request.

**Task 1 (In Progress):** Build the main game interface.

**Phase 1 (Completed):** Create Core HTML and CSS Structure
- Created `game.html` for the main game screen.
- Created `css/game.css` to style the three-column layout.
- Created `js/` directory and initial script files (`game.js`, `matrix.js`, `worm.js`).
- Implemented the falling symbols animation in the Matrix Display.

**Phase 2 (In Progress):** Develop the Three Main Displays
**Phase 2 (In Progress):** Develop the Three Main Displays

- **Progression Display (Left):** Show current problem and lock animation.
- **Problem Solving Display (Center):** Implement "Help" button and step-by-step solution display.
- **Matrix Display (Right):** Implemented falling symbols animation.
- **Matrix Display (Right):** Implemented falling symbols animation.

#### Phase 3 (In Progress): Implement Game Logic

- **Input Handling:** Add a click listener to the Matrix canvas to detect which symbol the player clicks.
- **Answer Checking:** Compare the clicked symbol with the next correct symbol in the solution.
- **Progression:** If the symbol is correct, reveal the character in the "Problem Solving Display"; if incorrect, provide visual feedback (e.g., a red flash).
- **Level Completion:** Detect when the entire solution is revealed and trigger a "level complete" state.
- **Level Completion:** Detect when the entire solution is revealed and trigger a "level complete" state.

#### Phase 4 (Next): Link Welcome Screen to Level Select

- Ensure the "Click to continue" ripple or Enter/Space key on `index.html` navigates to `level-select.html`.
- Verify `level-select.html` displays available levels and links to each `level-*-transformer.html` component.
- Ensure the "Click to continue" ripple or Enter/Space key on `index.html` navigates to `level-select.html`.
- Verify `level-select.html` displays available levels and links to each `level-*-transformer.html` component.
- **Spawning:** Implement logic to spawn a worm when a line of the math problem is completed.
- **Movement:** Animate the worm's movement within the "Problem Solving Display".
- **Symbol Stealing:** After 10 seconds, have the worm target a visible symbol, move towards it, and "carry" it to the top of the screen.
#### Phase 5: Create the Worm NPCs

- **Worm Class:** Create a `Worm` class in `js/worm.js` to manage individual worm properties (position, speed, state).
- **Spawning:** Implement logic to spawn a worm when a line of the math problem is completed.
- **Movement:** Animate the worm's movement within the "Problem Solving Display".
- **Symbol Stealing:** After 10 seconds, have the worm target a visible symbol, move towards it, and "carry" it to the top of the screen.
- **Interaction:**
  - Clicking the correct symbol on the Matrix display (the one the worm is carrying) destroys the worm.
  - Clicking the worm itself causes it to multiply (up to a maximum of 8).
  - **Interaction:**
    - Clicking the correct symbol on the Matrix display (the one the worm is carrying) destroys the worm.
    - Clicking the worm itself causes it to multiply (up to a maximum of 8).
