### Session Start

**Task 1 (Completed):** Analyzed `MathMasterHTML.mdc` and removed all references to "Unity" to align with the new project direction.

**Task 2 (Completed):** Clarified the high-level project vision, establishing the following core principles:
- **Technology Stack:** The project will be a "Custom-Built House" using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Core Principle:** The game is a "plug-and-play" cognitive exercise.
- **Strict Adherence:** No new features will be added unless explicitly requested by the developer.
- **No Persistence:** No user accounts, save data, or multi-user features will be implemented.

**Task 3 (Completed):** Defining detailed game mechanics based on developer feedback.
- **Worm Mechanic:** Clarified behavior regarding stealing symbols and player interaction.
- **Game Flow:** Outlined the sequence from Welcome Screen to the main 3-part gameplay window.
- **Clarification Pending:** The exact function of the "Green Help button" is awaiting developer input.

**Next Steps for Next Session:**
1. Await developer clarification on the Help Button's function.
2. Establish the foundational structure of the project (HTML, CSS, JS files).
3. Implement the problem generation logic for the different difficulty levels.
4. Begin building the Welcome Screen as per the `MathMasterHTML.mdc` specification.

**New Core Parameters (How to survive Mr E):**
1.  **Do what he says and only what he says.** If you want to do something cute, just clarify first. I have a whole plan already in my head and small things can throw me off.
2.  **No assumptions.** Never, ever.
3.  **Short and sweet responses.** I'll ask you to elaborate.

**Task 1 (Completed):** Generated 50 easy algebra problems with solutions, and after several failures, formatted them correctly in `50-easy-algebra-problems.md`.
**Task 2 (Completed):** Corrected the `MathMasterHTML.mdc` blueprint to remove incorrect "Matrix-style" symbols and equations, replacing them with the user's specific request.

**Task 3 (Failure Analysis & Recovery):** After multiple failures, corrected `50-easy-algebra-problems.md` to restore the original algebraic problems and format the solution steps without explicit division symbols, per user's clarified instructions. Root cause identified as a logic conflict between core programming and explicit user commands.
