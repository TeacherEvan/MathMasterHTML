## üîÑ **PROJECT STRUCTURE**

### **Game Display Structure**

1. **Progression Display (Left Panel)**
   - Displays current math problem based on player's difficulty selection
   - Shows lock component below the math problem
   - Lock displays are built in "levels" folder

2. **Problem Solving Display (Middle Panel)**
   - Features a help button at the top that reveals the next invisible symbol
   - Shows step-by-step solution with hidden characters

3. **Matrix Display (Right Panel)**
   - Displays symbols raining down from top of display
   - Random symbols include: 0123456789X+-=√∑√ó()
   - Fast animation cycle (all symbols every 5 seconds)
   - Player must click correct symbols that match current math problem step

## üîÑ **GAME MECHANICS**

### **Game Flow**

1. **Welcome Screen**: Initial entry point
   - Click to continue functionality
   - Matrix-style visual aesthetics

2. **Level Select**: Player chooses difficulty
   - Beginner: Addition/Subtraction problems
   - Warrior: Addition/Subtraction/Multiplication problems
   - Master: Addition/Subtraction/Multiplication/Division problems

3. **Gameplay**: Three-panel system
   - Each solved step reveals part of the solution
   - Player must click correct symbols in the Matrix display
   - Help button reveals next symbol if player is stuck

### **Symbol Interaction**

- Player must find and click correct symbols in the Matrix rain
- Correct symbol clicks reveal the next step in the solution
- Incorrect clicks provide visual feedback
- Level completion occurs when full solution is revealed

## üìÇ **PROJECT FILES**

### **HTML Files**
- `index.html` - Welcome screen with matrix animation
- `level-select.html` - Difficulty selection interface
- `game.html` - Main game with three-panel layout
- `lock-components/*.html` - Visual locks for each difficulty level

### **JavaScript Files**
- `js/game.js` - Core game logic and event handling
- `js/matrix.js` - Matrix display with falling symbols
- `js/worm.js` - Worm mechanics for advanced levels

### **CSS Files**
- `css/game.css` - Styling for the three-panel game layout

### **Asset Files**
- `Assets/Beginner_Lvl/beginner_problems.md` - Addition/Subtraction problems
- `Assets/Warrior_Lvl/warrior_problems.md` - Addition/Subtraction/Multiplication problems  
- `Assets/Master _Lvl/master_problems.md` - Addition/Subtraction/Multiplication/Division problems

## üõ† **IMPLEMENTATION NOTES**

### **Matrix Display** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- ‚úÖ Symbols (0123456789X+-=√∑√ó) fall continuously at varying speeds
- ‚úÖ Canvas-based animation with symbol tracking for click detection
- ‚úÖ Symbols reset at the top after reaching the bottom of the display
- ‚úÖ Click detection tied to the current problem's required next symbol
- ‚úÖ **ENHANCED**: Increased font size from 20px ‚Üí 32px for better visibility
- ‚úÖ **ENHANCED**: Slowed animation from 33ms ‚Üí 60ms intervals for easier clicking
- ‚úÖ **ENHANCED**: Improved click detection with tolerance-based targeting
- ‚úÖ **ENHANCED**: Added bold fonts and centered text alignment
- ‚úÖ **ENHANCED**: Implemented yellow highlight feedback on successful clicks

### **Problem Solving** ‚úÖ CRITICAL FIXES COMPLETED
- ‚úÖ **FIXED**: Solution now reveals SYMBOL BY SYMBOL (not character by character)
- ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED**: When a COMPLETE LINE of solution is finished ‚Üí triggers WORM spawning
- ‚úÖ **WORKING**: Help button reveals next symbol without requiring symbol click
- ‚úÖ **FIXED**: Now displaying full step-by-step solution from markdown files
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIAL**: Lock animations visible but need event triggers for step completion
- ‚úÖ **FIXED**: Solution display now visible in center panel (was completely hidden)

### **Navigation System** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- ‚úÖ Welcome screen ‚Üí Level Select ‚Üí Game
- ‚úÖ Back button returns to previous screen
- ‚úÖ Level completion returns to level select

### **Three-Panel Layout** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- ‚úÖ **Progression Display**: Math problem display and lock component integration
- ‚úÖ **Problem-Solving Display**: Help Button and hidden math problem area
- ‚úÖ **Matrix Display**: Enhanced matrix rain with improved responsiveness
- ‚úÖ **Lock Positioning**: Centered lock display vertically using flexbox alignment
- ‚úÖ **Visual Enhancements**: Added level-specific themes (Green/Gold/Red)

### **Worm Mechanics** üöß FRAMEWORK READY
- üöß Framework established in worm.js (placeholder ready)
- üöß CSS animations prepared for stealing/carrying symbols
- üöß 10-second behavior cycle planned
- üöß Click-to-destroy mechanism designed

## ‚ùå **URGENT MISSION - JULY 12, 2025**

**CRITICAL FIXES REQUIRED:**

1. **Complete lock animation integration with step completion events**
2. **Test symbol clicking and solution revelation functionality** 
3. **Verify worm spawning triggers on line completion**
4. **Ensure all lock types (level-1 through level-6) respond to game events**
5. **Final testing of complete game flow**

**CURRENT STATUS:**
- ‚úÖ Symbol-by-symbol revelation working
- ‚úÖ Step-by-step solutions displaying properly
- ‚úÖ Solution container visible in center display
- ‚úÖ Lock animations visible and functioning
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Lock integration with game events needs completion
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Testing required for symbol click ‚Üí solution reveal flow

**STATUS: NEAR COMPLETION - LOCK INTEGRATION AND TESTING REMAINING** ÔøΩ

## ‚úÖ **COMPLETED WORK - JULY 12, 2025**
**Session Focus**: Critical Game Mechanics Implementation & Bug Fixes

**MAJOR ACHIEVEMENTS:**

1. **Fixed Symbol-by-Symbol Revelation**: Complete rewrite of solution display system
2. **Implemented Step-by-Step Solutions**: Full parsing from markdown files with proper structure  
3. **Fixed Solution Container Visibility**: Restored visibility while maintaining clean interface
4. **Enhanced Matrix Display**: Symbols increased to 48px (50% larger), refresh indicator hidden
5. **Lock Animation Restoration**: Fixed CSS conflicts preventing lock displays
6. **Worm Spawning Integration**: Event system for line completion triggering

**CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATIONS:**
- **Symbol Revelation Mechanics**: `revealNextSymbol()` function with step-by-step processing
- **Line Completion Detection**: `problemLineCompleted` event dispatch system
- **Lock Integration Framework**: CSS fixes and JavaScript API preparation
- **Solution Parsing**: Complete markdown parsing with multi-step solution support

**STATUS: MAJOR MECHANICS IMPLEMENTED - LOCK INTEGRATION TESTING REQUIRED** üöÄ
