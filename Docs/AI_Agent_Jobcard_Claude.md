## ðŸ”„ **PROJECT STRUCTURE**

### **Game Display Structure**

1. **Progression Display (Left Panel)**
   - Displays current math problem based on player's difficulty selection
   - Shows lock component below the math problem
   - Lock displays are built in "levels" folder

2. **Problem Solving Display (Middle Panel)**
   - Features a help button at the top that reveals the next invisible symbol
   - Shows step-by-step solution with hidden characters

3. **Matrix Display (Right Panel)**
   - Displays symbols raining down from top of display
   - Random symbols include: 0123456789X+-=Ã·Ã—()
   - Fast animation cycle (all symbols every 5 seconds)
   - Player must click correct symbols that match current math problem step

## ðŸ”„ **GAME MECHANICS**

### **Game Flow**

1. **Welcome Screen**: Initial entry point
   - Click to continue functionality
   - Matrix-style visual aesthetics

2. **Level Select**: Player chooses difficulty
   - Beginner: Addition/Subtraction problems
   - Warrior: Addition/Subtraction/Multiplication problems
   - Master: Addition/Subtraction/Multiplication/Division problems

3. **Gameplay**: Three-panel system
   - Each solved step reveals part of the solution
   - Player must click correct symbols in the Matrix display
   - Help button reveals next symbol if player is stuck

### **Symbol Interaction**

- Player must find and click correct symbols in the Matrix rain
- Correct symbol clicks reveal the next step in the solution
- Incorrect clicks provide visual feedback
- Level completion occurs when full solution is revealed

## ðŸ›  **IMPLEMENTATION NOTES**

### **Matrix Display**
- Symbols (0123456789X+-=Ã·Ã—()) fall continuously at varying speeds
- Canvas-based animation with symbol tracking for click detection
- Symbols reset at the top after reaching the bottom of the display
- Click detection tied to the current problem's required next symbol

### **Problem Solving**
