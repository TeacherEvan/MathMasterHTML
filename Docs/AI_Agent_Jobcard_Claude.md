## üîÑ **PROJECT STRUCTURE**

### **Game Display Structure**

1. **Progression Display (Left Panel)**
   - Displays current math problem based on player's difficulty selection
   - Shows lock component below the math problem
   - Lock displays are built in "levels" folder

2. **Problem Solving Display (Middle Panel)**
   - Features a help button at the top that reveals the next invisible symbol
   - Shows step-by-step solution with hidden characters

3. **Matrix Display (Right Panel)**
   - Displays symbols raining down from top of display
   - Random symbols include: 0123456789X+-=√∑√ó()
   - Fast animation cycle (all symbols every 5 seconds)
   - Player must click correct symbols that match current math problem step

## üîÑ **GAME MECHANICS**

### **Game Flow**

1. **Welcome Screen**: Initial entry point
   - Click to continue functionality
   - Matrix-style visual aesthetics

2. **Level Select**: Player chooses difficulty
   - Beginner: Addition/Subtraction problems
   - Warrior: Addition/Subtraction/Multiplication problems
   - Master: Addition/Subtraction/Multiplication/Division problems

3. **Gameplay**: Three-panel system
   - Each solved step reveals part of the solution
   - Player must click correct symbols in the Matrix display
   - Help button reveals next symbol if player is stuck

### **Symbol Interaction**

- Player must find and click correct symbols in the Matrix rain
- Correct symbol clicks reveal the next step in the solution
- Incorrect clicks provide visual feedback
- Level completion occurs when full solution is revealed

## üìÇ **PROJECT FILES**

### **HTML Files**
- `index.html` - Welcome screen with matrix animation
- `level-select.html` - Difficulty selection interface
- `game.html` - Main game with three-panel layout
- `lock-components/*.html` - Visual locks for each difficulty level

### **JavaScript Files**
- `js/game.js` - Core game logic and event handling
- `js/matrix.js` - Matrix display with falling symbols
- `js/worm.js` - Worm mechanics for advanced levels

### **CSS Files**
- `css/game.css` - Styling for the three-panel game layout

### **Asset Files**
- `Assets/Beginner_Lvl/beginner_problems.md` - Addition/Subtraction problems
- `Assets/Warrior_Lvl/warrior_problems.md` - Addition/Subtraction/Multiplication problems  
- `Assets/Master _Lvl/master_problems.md` - Addition/Subtraction/Multiplication/Division problems

## üõ† **IMPLEMENTATION NOTES**

### **Matrix Display** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- ‚úÖ Symbols (0123456789X+-=√∑√ó) fall continuously at varying speeds
- ‚úÖ Canvas-based animation with symbol tracking for click detection
- ‚úÖ Symbols reset at the top after reaching the bottom of the display
- ‚úÖ Click detection tied to the current problem's required next symbol
- ‚úÖ **ENHANCED**: Increased font size from 20px ‚Üí 32px for better visibility
- ‚úÖ **ENHANCED**: Slowed animation from 33ms ‚Üí 60ms intervals for easier clicking
- ‚úÖ **ENHANCED**: Improved click detection with tolerance-based targeting
- ‚úÖ **ENHANCED**: Added bold fonts and centered text alignment
- ‚úÖ **ENHANCED**: Implemented yellow highlight feedback on successful clicks

### **Problem Solving** üöß NEEDS CRITICAL FIXES
- ‚ùå **URGENT FIX NEEDED**: Solution must be revealed SYMBOL BY SYMBOL (not character by character)
- ‚ùå **CRITICAL**: When a COMPLETE LINE of solution is finished ‚Üí triggers WORM spawning
- ‚úÖ Help button reveals next symbol without requiring symbol click
- ‚ùå **BROKEN**: Currently only showing space for direct answer instead of full step-by-step solution
- ‚ùå **REMOVE**: Text visibility issues in center display and lock area

### **Navigation System** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- ‚úÖ Welcome screen ‚Üí Level Select ‚Üí Game
- ‚úÖ Back button returns to previous screen
- ‚úÖ Level completion returns to level select

### **Three-Panel Layout** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- ‚úÖ **Progression Display**: Math problem display and lock component integration
- ‚úÖ **Problem-Solving Display**: Help Button and hidden math problem area
- ‚úÖ **Matrix Display**: Enhanced matrix rain with improved responsiveness
- ‚úÖ **Lock Positioning**: Centered lock display vertically using flexbox alignment
- ‚úÖ **Visual Enhancements**: Added level-specific themes (Green/Gold/Red)

### **Worm Mechanics** üöß FRAMEWORK READY
- üöß Framework established in worm.js (placeholder ready)
- üöß CSS animations prepared for stealing/carrying symbols
- üöß 10-second behavior cycle planned
- üöß Click-to-destroy mechanism designed

## ‚ùå **URGENT MISSION - JULY 12, 2025**

**CRITICAL FIXES REQUIRED:**

1. **Remove unwanted text visibility issues in center display and lock area**
2. **Enlarge matrix symbols by 30% and reduce speed by 10%**
3. **Fix solution reveal system - SYMBOL BY SYMBOL revelation**
4. **Implement COMPLETE LINE detection to trigger worm spawning**
5. **Parse full step-by-step solutions from Assets markdown files**

**GAME MECHANICS CORRECTION:**
- Player clicks symbols in Matrix Display ‚Üí reveals next SYMBOL in solution
- When COMPLETE LINE of solution is revealed ‚Üí triggers WORM spawn
- Solution must show FULL step-by-step process (not just final answer)

**STATUS: CRITICAL FIXES IN PROGRESS** üö®

## ‚úÖ **COMPLETED WORK - JULY 12, 2025**
**Session Focus**: Game Interface Development & Matrix Enhancement

**MAJOR ACHIEVEMENTS:**
1. **Fixed Matrix Display Issues**: Larger symbols (32px), slower speed, highly responsive clicks
2. **Enhanced Visual Feedback**: Yellow highlights, better animations, level themes
3. **Improved Layout**: Vertically centered lock display, three-section balance
4. **Code Quality**: Clean matrix.js implementation with robust click detection

**STATUS: CURRENT WORKLOAD COMPLETE - READY FOR WORM MECHANICS IMPLEMENTATION** üöÄ
