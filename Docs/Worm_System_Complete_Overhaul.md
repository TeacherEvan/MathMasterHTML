# 🐛 Worm System Complete Overhaul

## Implementation Date: October 5, 2025

---

## 🎯 Overview

Complete redesign of the worm system to create a more engaging, interactive, and strategic gameplay element. Worms now properly spawn from console buttons, crawl realistically, target revealed symbols, and create meaningful player decisions.

---

## ✅ Implemented Features

### 1. **Crawling Movement (Not Floating)**

- ✅ Replaced floating animation with realistic inchworm-style crawling
- ✅ CSS animation uses `scaleX` and `scaleY` transforms for squash-and-stretch effect
- ✅ JavaScript applies rotation based on movement direction
- ✅ Each segment has staggered animation delay (0.15s) for wave effect
- ✅ Animation duration: 0.8s for natural crawling pace

**CSS Changes:**

```css
@keyframes worm-crawl {
    0% { transform: translateY(0) scaleX(1); }
    25% { transform: translateY(-2px) scaleX(1.15); }
    50% { transform: translateY(0) scaleX(0.9); }
    75% { transform: translateY(2px) scaleX(1.1); }
    100% { transform: translateY(0) scaleX(1); }
}
```

### 2. **Console Button Spawning**

- ✅ Worms visually emerge from empty console slots
- ✅ Spawn triggered by `problemLineCompleted` event
- ✅ Console button locks when worm spawns (unusable until worm destroyed/escapes)
- ✅ Console slot tracking via `lockedConsoleSlots` Set
- ✅ Worm stores reference to its origin console slot

### 3. **Intelligent Target Detection**

- ✅ Worms roam for 10 seconds OR until red symbol appears
- ✅ NEW EVENT: `symbolRevealed` dispatched when user clicks correct symbol
- ✅ Worms detect revealed symbols and rush to them at 2x speed
- ✅ Target prioritization: if worm has specific target, seeks that first
- ✅ Falls back to random revealed symbol if target unavailable

### 4. **Symbol Stealing with Visual Drag**

- ✅ Worm "steals" revealed RED symbols (not hidden ones)
- ✅ Stolen symbol hidden and marked with `data-stolen` attribute
- ✅ Symbol appears as carried badge above worm (`<div class="carried-symbol">`)
- ✅ Worm returns to console hole with symbol
- ✅ Symbol stays HIDDEN after worm escapes (must re-click in Panel C)

### 5. **LSD Rainbow Flash Effect**

- ✅ Activates when worm picks up stolen symbol
- ✅ 20% speed boost (base 2.0 → 2.4 when carrying)
- ✅ CSS hue-rotate animation cycles through full rainbow spectrum
- ✅ Enhanced drop-shadow effects with color cycling
- ✅ Animation speed: 0.3s for intense flashing

### 6. **Click to Clone (Not Multiply)**

- ✅ Clicking worm creates exact clone with SAME mission
- ✅ Clone inherits `targetSymbol` and `isRushingToTarget` state
- ✅ Max 7 worms enforced (down from 9)
- ✅ Flash effect when max reached
- ✅ Clone birth animation for visual feedback

### 7. **Explosion on Matching Rain Click**

- ✅ If user clicks matching symbol in Panel C while worm has it, worm EXPLODES
- ✅ Stolen symbol returns to original position as revealed
- ✅ `data-stolen` attribute removed
- ✅ Symbol becomes `revealed-symbol` again
- ✅ Explosion animation (worm-clicked class) with 300ms delay before removal

### 8. **Panel B Boundary Restriction**

- ✅ Worms confined strictly to Panel B area
- ✅ 20px margin from edges to prevent clipping
- ✅ Reflection physics on boundary collision
- ✅ Direction reversal maintains crawling realism

### 9. **Speed Configuration**

- ✅ Base speed: **2.0** (increased from 1.5)
- ✅ Carrying speed: **2.4** (20% boost)
- ✅ Rush speed: **4.0** (2x base when rushing to revealed symbol)

## 🎮 Gameplay Flow

### Complete Worm Lifecycle

```
1. SPAWN
   ↓ Row completed → worm emerges from console slot
   ↓ Console button LOCKS

2. ROAM (10 seconds OR red symbol appears)
   ↓ Crawl around Panel B with bouncing physics
   ↓ Rotate to face movement direction
   ↓ Wait for `symbolRevealed` event

3. RUSH (when red symbol detected)
   ↓ Increase speed to 4.0
   ↓ Navigate toward target symbol
   ↓ Reach symbol within 30px

4. STEAL
   ↓ Hide symbol (mark data-stolen=true)
   ↓ Activate LSD rainbow flash
   ↓ Speed boost to 2.4
   ↓ Carry symbol badge above worm

5A. ESCAPE (successful theft)
    ↓ Return to console hole
    ↓ Symbol stays hidden
    ↓ Console unlocks
    ↓ User must re-click in Panel C to recover

5B. EXPLOSION (user clicks matching symbol)
    ↓ Worm explodes with animation
    ↓ Symbol returns to Panel B revealed
    ↓ Console unlocks
    ↓ Worm removed from play

6. CLONING (user clicks worm)
   ↓ Create duplicate with same target
   ↓ Both worms continue mission
   ↓ Max 7 worms enforced
```

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Event-Driven Architecture

```javascript
// NEW EVENTS
document.addEventListener('symbolRevealed', (event) => {
    // detail: { symbol: string, element: HTMLElement }
    // Triggers worms to rush to revealed symbol
});

document.addEventListener('symbolClicked', (event) => {
    // detail: { symbol: string }
    // Checks if clicked symbol matches stolen symbol → explode worm
});

document.addEventListener('problemLineCompleted', (event) => {
    // Triggers worm spawn from console
});
```

### Key Data Structure

```javascript
const wormData = {
    id: string,                    // Unique identifier
    element: HTMLElement,          // DOM reference
    stolenSymbol: string | null,   // Symbol currently stolen
    targetElement: HTMLElement,    // DOM reference to stolen symbol
    targetSymbol: string | null,   // Symbol worm is targeting
    x: number,                     // Position X
    y: number,                     // Position Y
    velocityX: number,             // Movement velocity X
    velocityY: number,             // Movement velocity Y
    active: boolean,               // Is worm active
    hasStolen: boolean,            // Has worm stolen symbol
    isRushingToTarget: boolean,    // Is worm rushing to red symbol
    roamingEndTime: number,        // Timestamp when roaming ends
    isFlickering: boolean,         // LSD effect active
    baseSpeed: 2.0,                // Base movement speed
    currentSpeed: 2.0,             // Current speed (with boosts)
    consoleSlotIndex: number,      // Console slot that spawned worm
    consoleSlotElement: HTMLElement, // Console slot reference
    fromConsole: boolean,          // True if spawned from console
    crawlPhase: number,            // Animation phase (0 to 2π)
    direction: number              // Movement direction in radians
};
```

## 🎨 Visual Enhancements

### Crawling Effect

- Segments compress and stretch (scaleX: 0.9 → 1.15)
- Vertical bounce (translateY: -2px to +2px)
- Staggered timing creates wave motion
- Body rotates to face movement direction

### LSD Flash

- Hue rotation through full 360° spectrum
- Drop-shadow color matches hue
- 7 keyframes for smooth rainbow transition
- Red → Orange → Yellow → Green → Blue → Indigo → Violet

### Carried Symbol Badge

- Positioned 30px above worm
- Red gradient background with glow
- Pulsating glow animation
- Rotates with worm body

---

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

1. **X/x Normalization**: Both uppercase and lowercase X treated identically
2. **Boundary Clamping**: Worms no longer escape Panel B
3. **Console Lock State**: Slots properly unlock after worm completion
4. **Symbol Visibility**: Stolen symbols correctly hidden until re-clicked
5. **Event Dispatching**: `symbolRevealed` event fires on correct symbol reveal

---

## 📊 Performance Optimizations

- `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth 60fps animation
- Direct style manipulation (no CSS transitions for position)
- Efficient boundary checking with early returns
- Set-based console slot tracking (O(1) lookups)
- Event delegation for click handling

---

## 🎯 Strategic Gameplay Impact

### Player Decisions

1. **Click Worm Early**: Create clone army, but risk overwhelming yourself
2. **Let Worm Steal**: Focus on solving, accept need to re-click symbol
3. **Race to Click**: Try to click matching symbol in Panel C before escape
4. **Console Management**: Strategically allow worms to return for slot reuse

### Difficulty Scaling

- More revealed symbols = more worm targets
- Max 7 worms prevents overwhelming chaos
- 5-second timer creates urgency
- Clone mechanic rewards accurate clicking

---

## 🚀 Bonus Features Implemented

### Symbol Rain Frequency Fix

- **Problem**: Random spawning meant some symbols took too long to appear
- **Solution**: Guaranteed spawn system ensures all symbols appear every 5 seconds
- **Implementation**:

  ```javascript
  let lastSpawnTime = {};
  symbols.forEach(sym => lastSpawnTime[sym] = Date.now());
  
  // In animation loop:
  if (currentTime - lastSpawnTime[sym] > 5000) {
      createFallingSymbol(randomColumn, false, sym);
  }
  ```

### Display Resolution Indicator Hidden

- **Problem**: Green info box in bottom-right visible to players
- **Solution**: Set `opacity: 0` and `visibility: hidden` while preserving functionality
- **Benefit**: Cleaner UI, debugging info still in console logs
