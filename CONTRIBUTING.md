# Contributing to MathMaster Algebra

Thank you for your interest in contributing to MathMaster Algebra! This educational application benefits greatly from community contributions.

## 🎯 Project Vision

MathMaster Algebra aims to make algebra learning engaging and accessible through:
- Immersive visual design inspired by the Matrix
- Progressive difficulty levels that build confidence
- Step-by-step solution guidance for effective learning
- Responsive design that works across all devices

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Development Setup

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Navigate to the application directory:
   ```bash
   cd MathMasterHTML/MathMaster-Algebra
   ```
4. Start a local server for testing:
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```
5. Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser

## 🎨 Design Guidelines

### Visual Consistency
- Maintain the Matrix-inspired theme with green neon colors
- Use consistent animation timing and easing
- Ensure all UI elements have appropriate hover and focus states
- Keep the futuristic, educational atmosphere

### Educational Standards
- All mathematical content should be pedagogically sound
- Solution steps must be clear and logically ordered
- Problems should progress in appropriate difficulty
- Include diverse problem types within each level

## 🧮 Content Contributions

### Adding New Problems

1. Problems are stored in markdown format in `Assets/` directories
2. Each problem should include:
   - Clear problem statement
   - Step-by-step solution breakdown
   - Appropriate difficulty for the level

### Problem Format Example
```markdown
## Problem X: Description

X. `equation here`
   - Step 1: Initial equation
   - Step 2: Simplification
   - Step 3: Isolation
   - Step 4: Final answer
```

## 🛠 Code Contributions

### JavaScript Guidelines
- Use ES6+ features consistently
- Include comprehensive console logging for debugging
- Follow existing naming conventions
- Ensure cross-browser compatibility

### CSS Guidelines
- Use CSS Grid and Flexbox for layouts
- Implement responsive design principles
- Maintain consistent spacing and typography
- Use CSS custom properties for theme colors

### Testing
- Test across multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Verify responsive behavior on different screen sizes
- Ensure mathematical accuracy of all educational content
- Check animation performance on lower-end devices
